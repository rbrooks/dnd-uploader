# Dnd Uploader

## Vanilla JS DnD Multi-File Uploader with Resumes

* **Uses the venerable [Nginx Upload Module]([url](https://github.com/vkholodkov/nginx-upload-module/)https://github.com/vkholodkov/nginx-upload-module/)**
* **Simultanous multiple files**
* **Resumable** - Just drag the files back in later.

Hadn't been done before on the entire Internet, when I wrote it. I had to reverse engineer this [Silverlight plugin's C# Code]([url](https://github.com/dmitry-dedukhin/MrUploader/blob/master/MrUploader/Code/Uploader.cs)https://github.com/dmitry-dedukhin/MrUploader/blob/master/MrUploader/Code/Uploader.cs)
